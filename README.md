## ðŸŽ¯ Selected Artifacts
1. **Milestone One â€“ PWM LED Control**  
   Controlled an LED using PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) on the Raspberry Pi. Implemented frequency and duty cycle changes to create a fading effect.  

2. **Milestone Two â€“ UART Serial Communication with LED**  
   Built a state machine to handle serial input (`ON` / `OFF`) and toggle an LED. Demonstrates ability to design interface software that responds predictably to external inputs.

## ðŸªž Reflection

### Summarize the project and what problem it was solving
This project focused on programming the Raspberry Pi to interact with hardware components while applying concepts like PWM and UART. The problems it solved centered around controlling real hardware with software and designing reliable state machines.  

### What did you do particularly well?
I broke complex problems into smaller tasks and separated functionality into clear parts (input parsing, state machine, LED control), making my code easier to manage and test.  

### Where could you improve?
I could improve my debugging process when testing hardware, by documenting steps and isolating issues between wiring and code more efficiently.  

### What tools/resources are you adding to your support network?
- Raspberry Pi official documentation  
- GPIO/PWM library references  
- Raspberry Pi Stack Exchange and forums  
- GitHub for version control and project sharing  

### What skills are transferable?
- Writing and implementing state machines  
- Designing modular, readable software  
- Interfacing software logic with hardware (PWM, UART, GPIO)  

### How did you make the project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I used modular design, consistent naming, and comments to explain logic. Avoided hardcoding values when possible, using parameters to keep code flexible for different hardware setups.
